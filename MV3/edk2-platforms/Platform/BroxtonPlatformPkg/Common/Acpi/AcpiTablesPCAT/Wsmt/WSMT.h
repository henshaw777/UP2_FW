/*
FIXED_COMM_BUFFERS - Firmware setting this bit should refer to the SMM Communication ACPI Table defined in the UEFI 2.6 specification.
                     Firmware should also consider all other possible data exchanges between SMM and non-SMM,
                     including but not limited to EFI_SMM_COMMUNICATION_PROTOCOL, ACPINVS in ASL code,
                     general purpose registers as buffer pointers, etc.

COMM_BUFFER_NESTED_PTR_PROTECTION - Firmware setting this bit must also set the FIXED_COMM_BUFFERS bit.

SYSTEM_RESOURCE_PROTECTION - After ExitBootServices(), firmware setting this bit shall not allow any software to make changes
                             to the locations of IOMMU's, interrupt controllers, PCI Configuration Space,
                             the Firmware ACPI Control Structure (FACS), or any registers reported through ACPI fixed tables
                             (e.g. PMx Control registers, reset register, etc.).
                             This also includes disallowing changes to RAM layout and ensuring that decodes to RAM
                             and any system resources as described above take priority over software configurable registers.
                             For example, if software configures a PCI Express BAR to overlay RAM,
                             accesses by the CPU to the affected system physical addresses must decode to RAM.
