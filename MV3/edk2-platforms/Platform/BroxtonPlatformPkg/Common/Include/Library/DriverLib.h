  Locate a matching ACPI device path node

  This routine walks the device path attached to the ControllerHandle
  and determines if the last (non-end) device path node is an
  ACPI_HID_DEVICE_PATH node and if the CID or _CIDSTR values
  match the specified values.

  @param [in] CompatibleIdentification  The value to match against the CID
                                        value in the ACPI_HID_DEVICE_PATH
                                        node.  This value must be zero when
                                        the CompatibleIdentification
                                        value is not NULL.
  @param [in] CompatibleIdentificationString  This value is specified as NULL
                                              when the CompatibleIdentification
                                              value is non-zero.  When the
                                              CompatibleIdentification value is
                                              zero (0), this value should point
                                              to a zero terminated charater
                                              string value.

  @return           When the ACPI device path node is found, this routine
                    returns the pointer to the ACPI_HID_DEVICE_PATH node.
                    Otherwise when the device path is not found this routine
                    returns NULL.

  Retrieves a Unicode string that is the user readable name of the controller
