How to generate a new public-private key pair:
1. Ensure you have python 2.7 installed on your host system.
2. Ensure you have copied OpenSsl.exe into the EepromBinary\Utilities\OpenSsl directory.
3. Ensure you have modified GenerateBinary.py script to point to your projects files.
4. Starting in the root EEPROM directory, use the following command:
   Python.exe EepromBinary\ProjectName\GenerateBinary.py
   This will generate 2 files, EepromStruct.h & the EepromBinary.bin files.
   You might see "ERROR: Unable to set value at offset xx." These can be ignored.
