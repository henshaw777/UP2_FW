How to install an EEPROM image into an EEPROM:
1. Generate the EEPROM binary.
2. Copy the EEPROM binary and EepromApp.efi onto a USB drive.
3. Insert the USB drive into the target system.
4. Boot to the UEFI Shell.
5. Change to the FS that contains the files.
6. Use the following command to write the binary to the EEPROM:
    EepromApp.efi -b # -a # -w 1 EepromBinary.bin
    -b # indicates which I2C bus the EEPROM is hanging off of
    -a # indicates what the 7-bit address is for the EEPROM
    # should be replaced with the appropriate number in either
      decimal (##) or hexidecimal (0x##) format
