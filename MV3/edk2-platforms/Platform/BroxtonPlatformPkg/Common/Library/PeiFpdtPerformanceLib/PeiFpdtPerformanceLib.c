/** @file
  Performance library instance used in PEI phase.

  This file implements Performance Library class in MdePkg. It converts performance data
  to PEI GUID event, and creates performance logging GUIDed HOB on the first performance
  logging and then logs the performance data to the GUIDed HOB. Due to the limitation
  of temporary RAM, the maximum number of performance logging entry is specified by PcdMaxPeiPerformanceLogEntries.
