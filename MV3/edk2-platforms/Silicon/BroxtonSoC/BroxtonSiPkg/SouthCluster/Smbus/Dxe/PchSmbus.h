  SMBus DXE Module Entry Point.
  
  - Introduction
    The SMBus module is a DXE driver that provides a standard way to execute an SMBus command.

  - @pre
    - @link SC_POLICY SC_POLICY_HOB @endlink
      - This module uses the parameters in SmbusConfig for platform reserved (non ARP capable) addresses.

  - @result
    The SMBus driver produces EFI_SMBUS_HC_PROTOCOL which is documented in the SMBus Host Controller
    Protocol Specification.
