/** @file
  Register names for PMC device.

  Conventions:

  - Prefixes:
    Definitions beginning with "R_" are registers
    Definitions beginning with "B_" are bits within registers
    Definitions beginning with "V_" are meaningful values of bits within the registers
    Definitions beginning with "S_" are register sizes
    Definitions beginning with "N_" are the bit position
  - In general, SC registers are denoted by "_PCH_" in register names
  - Registers / bits that are different between SC generations are denoted by
    "_PCH_<generation_name>_" in register/bit names. e.g., "_PCH_CHV_"
  - Registers / bits that are different between SKUs are denoted by "_<SKU_name>"
    at the end of the register/bit names
  - Registers / bits of new devices introduced in a SC generation will be just named
    as "_PCH_" without <generation_name> inserted.
