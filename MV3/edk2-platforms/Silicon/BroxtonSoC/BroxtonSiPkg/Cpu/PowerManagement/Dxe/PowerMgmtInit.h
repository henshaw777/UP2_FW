/**
  Initialize the power management support.
  This function will do boot time configuration:
    Install into SMRAM/SMM
    Detect HW capabilities and SW configuration
    Initialize HW and software state (primarily MSR and ACPI tables)
    Install SMI handlers for runtime interfacess

  @param[in] ImageHandle  Pointer to the loaded image protocol for this driver
  @param[in] SystemTable  Pointer to the EFI System Table

  @retval    EFI_SUCCESS   The driver installed/initialized correctly.
  @retval    Driver will ASSERT in debug builds on error. PPM functionality is considered critical for mobile systems.
